# Hero Title Suggestions

Here are several authentic, less salesy title options for your hero section:

## Option 1 (Simple & Direct)
**"Selling Your Home in DC, VA & MD?"**
*Subtitle: "Expert guidance to help you navigate the process with confidence."*

## Option 2 (Conversational)
**"Thinking About Selling Your Home?"**
*Subtitle: "Let's discuss your options in Washington DC, Virginia, and Maryland."*

## Option 3 (Location-Focused)
**"Sell Your Home in the DMV"**
*Subtitle: "Expert real estate guidance for sellers in Washington DC, Virginia, and Maryland."*

## Option 4 (Question-Based)
**"Ready to Sell Your Home?"**
*Subtitle: "Get expert guidance for selling in DC, VA, and MD."*

## Option 5 (Personal & Authentic)
**"Hi, I'm Fred. Let's Talk About Selling Your Home."**
*Subtitle: "Expert real estate agent helping sellers in Washington DC, Virginia, and Maryland."*

## Option 6 (Benefit-Focused but Authentic)
**"Sell Your Home with Confidence"**
*Subtitle: "Expert guidance for home sellers in DC, VA & MD."*

## Option 7 (Simple & Professional)
**"Home Selling Services in DC, VA & MD"**
*Subtitle: "Expert real estate guidance to help you sell your home."*

## My Recommendation:
**Option 2 or Option 5** - They feel the most authentic and conversational, like you're actually talking to the seller rather than selling to them.
